## Discription

In this project we aim to calculate the ground energy state of a spin glass material.
Spin glass is a magnetic alloy material that behaves quantumly and can be represented by the Transverse field Ising Model.
It is a complex system that nature can't solve on it's own. Herein comes Quantum Computation!
we use Qiskit to build a circuit simulating four atoms in a TIM configuration.
by using Quantum gates , we can generate a large enough number of varable TIM states that we can then calculate the Hamiltonian for.

finally we use the VQE algorithm from qiskit to minimize those hamiltonians and find the lowest one.

### Libraries used to accomplish this:
- Numpy
- Qiskit algorithms
- Qiskit Opflow
- Qiskit utils
